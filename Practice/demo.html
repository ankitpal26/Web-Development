    Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) 
    in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its 
    name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his 
    team changed the name from Oak to Java.
